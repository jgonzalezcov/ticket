# ticket

## **Challenge Conditions:**

### Building

The 3 parts of this challenge are incorporated into a single file, in order to reduce the number of documents to review.

#### **Part Challenge 1:**

By clicking on the image in the image that the logos of the events (Musical groups) are found, a red border of 2 pixels will be added and when clicking again, this border will be removed.
The action of placing a red border with a width of 2px to an image, is done by clicking on the image where the logos of the events are located.

#### **Part Challenge 2:**

It must be validated that the number of Sticker is not greater than 10 among the 3 types of Sticker available. For that there is an input below each logo found in the main image, where the user can
enter a number. In case the sum of all the selected stickers is less
or equal to 10, the number of stickers worn is indicated in a new paragraph. Example "you carry
5 stickers" in any other case a text will be displayed that says "You have too many
stickers". In addition, the message "You have not selected any ticket" is added when no amount of ticket has been selected. On the other hand, the validation of the entry is also carried out, which must be numerical and between 0 and 10.

#### **Part Challenge 3:**

Validation is performed with 3 select and options with digits from 0 to 9 (The challenge asks for 1 to 9, but this would provide us with fewer possible combinations), when clicking on
the enter option verifies that the password is 911 and in that case it shows below
of the enter button, a paragraph with the content "password 1 correct", in case the
password is 714 will be displayed in the paragraph "password 2 is correct", if you enter another
value will show "wrong password".
